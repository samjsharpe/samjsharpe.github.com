        <h3>The Present</h3>

        <p>I am currently rejoining Rackspace Hosting as a Custom System Engineer.</p>

        <h3>Recent History</h3>

        <p>I was recently an Operations Engineer working for the UK Government. Some of the projects
        I worked on can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov">@alphagov</a> organisation,
        although the vast majority of my current commits are on private repos. I'm one of a team of
        people working within the <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a>
        to build and run next-gen infrastructures for government web platforms. The tools we work with are
        <a href="https://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a>, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>,
        <a href="http://nginx.org/en/">NginX</a>, <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish</a>,
        <a href="http://unicorn.bogomips.org/">Unicorn</a> and <a
            href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, among many others.</p>

        <p>Before I worked for GDS, I was a Senior System Engineer (SSE) for <a
        href="http://www.rackspace.co.uk">Rackspace Hosting</a> working with a large number of
        clients within APAC and EMEA on their Linux Hosting needs. I have an extensive amount of
        experience configuring a traditional LAMP stack, advising on scaling and on-demand
        technologies such as Rackspace Cloud, and dealing rapidly with emerging issues. It is
        here I learnt about Mail (<a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a> and <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qmail">Qmail</a>), <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">
        Apache</a>, <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> and <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a></p>

        <h3>Distant Past</h3>

        <p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far away, I used to work for <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk">
        Imperial College</a> as a "Unix Analyst". I worked my way up from Desktop Support into this
        position which involved administering a large number of RedHat Linux, Fedora Linux and Sun Solaris
        systems used both for business (running Oracle Business Suite and OracleDB) and for teaching
        (Desktops and Servers). Maintaining multiple environments with snapshots of a 900GB Oracle DB
        was not something that I would want to do forever.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>

        <p>Not that it's particularly relevant, but I have a BEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering
        from the University of London and an Associateship of the City and Guilds Institute (ACGI)
        from Imperial College. I've done a lot more since then that is more relevant, but everyone seems
        to want to know where I studied and what degree I have for some reason.</p>
