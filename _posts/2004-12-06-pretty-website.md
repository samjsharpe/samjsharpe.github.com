First of all, those of you using Internet Explorer won't appreciate this, because you browser
has appalling support for transparent PNG images and is generally shite anyway. I have two
recommendations for you:

1. upgrade your operating system
2. failing 1. ) upgrade your browser

For those of you still with me, you'll notice that I've been playing with GIMP supplied by
DarwinPorts and some CSS to create a nicer look for this page as a tribute to my old
fireburst.co.uk URL. The background is a stock image of a fire, slightly cropped and fixed
in the bottom right corner (notice how it stays there when you resize?) and the menu and
posts have a 50% transparent black background (note the fire floating under the menu)â€¦

I've tweaked the rest of the style to match - but I think you'll agree that Black and Orange
is a pleasing combination.

I'm pleased anyway.
