title: Managing your problems

In [one of my previous posts](/2015/09/20/maybe-you-drink-too-much/) I mentioned that I'd come back to 16th November 2013 and as today happens to be the 2-year anniversary, I thought now might be about the right time.

First up, I'd like to talk about what it feels like to be addicted to alcohol.
Ask yourself some questions:

- Do you ever drink to survive a social situation?
- Do you ever count down the days/hours/minutes until the next time you can drink?
- Do you ever drink to fall asleep?
- Do you ever drink because you are bored or lonely?
- Do you drink most nights?
- If you aren't drinking, do you miss it?

I've been in a place where the answers to all of those questions is yes. That's really
not a good place to be in, but it's not something you should be ashamed of or hide.

Absolutely the best way of managing an over-reliance on alcohol is abstinence. That's a
fact, not some preachy rubbish from a teetotaler. If you have a problem with drinking,
the single most effective method of controlling alcoholism is total abstinence. It's
effective (it's actually what AA recommends) and there is good evidence that it has a
lower rate of recidivism than other options when combined with other recommended
actions (in the case of AA, that means regular meeting attendance)

Unfortunately abstinence not going to be a workable option for everyone.
