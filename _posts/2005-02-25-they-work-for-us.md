Following on from [this post](http://web.archive.org/web/20051023064857/http://www.imperialviolet.org/page24.html#e470)
on Adam’s weblog (incidently, sort out your line endings man!), where he quotes
from Brian Sedgemore MP on the Terrorism Bill currently proposed by the Government:

> It is a foul calumny that we do today. Not since the Act of Settlement 1701 has
> Parliament usurped the powers of the judiciary and allowed the Executive to
> lock up people without trial in times of peace. May the Government be damned
> for it.

I would like to also recommend that everyone reads the [Hansard link](http://web.archive.org/web/20051218150251/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050223/debtext/50223-21.htm) Adam posted
all the way through. A few pages in, you’ll come across another apposite
observation from the personal experiences of yet another Labour MP (Barbara
Follett) opposed to detention without trial:

> My first husband was put under house arrest because the apartheid state

Now I personally didn’t vote for a dictatorial oppressive Government in the
last election, but them I’m a often accused of being borderline fascist so I
voted Conservative. Perhaps anyone who did vote in a constituency where Labour
has a chance (I’m in Westminster, it’s ‘Tory heartland) should be re-examining
their beliefs and priorities, unless they particularly like living in a Police
State where citizens carry mandatory identity cards 24/7 and are subject to
detention without trial.

To be honest, I don’t care who you vote for, my conscience is clean. Just don’t
vote for the grinning idiot and his party again, please!
