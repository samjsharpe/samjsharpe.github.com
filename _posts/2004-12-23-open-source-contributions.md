title: Open Source Contributions

One of the major principles of Open Source software is that users are free to suggest modifications
and fixes. On particular project I use pretty often is the DarwinPorts collection.

Normally I wouldn't bother doing anything, relying on others to do the work. But Gimp v2.2 came out,
I wanted it, but it wasnâ€™t yet in the Ports. So I modified the Portfile, checked it compiled and
woohoo, there was Gimp 2.2.0. Which left me in a quandry, do I keep quiet about my little hack, or
do I hand out the information to everyone?

In the end, the finer principles won. I submitted it, and today my modification was [committed to the
DarwinPorts tree](http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2494). Now everyone can enjoy that Gimpy Goodness for Christmas.
