Alcoholism, the dirty secret I don't want to talk about, how I discovered it and what I did next...

I once asked myself the question "does anyone else think you drink too much". The date was 16th November 2013. Some
dates become important — I can remember my birthday, I can remember my sister's birthday, but I have trouble
remembering what year my nephews were born. We'll come back to that 16/11/2013 date later.

The answer to the question was "yes" — I'd been drinking far more than I should, and for quite a long period of time,
but this highlights one of the problems I had with alcohol — my medium term memory is appalling. I can certainly
tell you about most of my pre-college years and definitely tell you about last week or last month, but ask me to
recall anything about the last 15 years or so and my mind is a blank.
